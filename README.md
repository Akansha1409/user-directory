✨ A responsive frontend application built with React and Tailwind CSS.

A clean **User Directory Application** designed to evaluate frontend engineering skills. This application allows users to view, search, and add users using the **JSONPlaceholder API**. It features a modern UI with glassmorphism effects, real-time filtering, and local data persistence.
